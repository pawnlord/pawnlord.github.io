			<p>An X11 Tiling Window Manager<br>
				A tiling window manager for Linux using X11 and Xlib. Tiling uses a <a
					href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree" id="inline-link" class="link-hover">quadtree</a> for
				partitioning space.
				It is not compatible with as many applications as I would like, but I have been using it on my Linux
				laptop
				for a while now and it is entirely useable.

			<p>A kernel written in C for x86 processors <br>
				The main goal of this project was to be able to do some simple kernel operations, like reading and
				writing to a terminal, and maybe one or two more advanced features, but it slowly grew in to
				a much bigger project as I realized how much I wanted to do.
				Currently implemented features include a malloc implementation, virtualized memory, and some reading and
				writing syscalls, with multiple tasks currently in production.
				Currently planned features still include file operations, though we will see if I get to that.

			<p>An emulator for the original Gameboy<br>
				This was a very fun project. Emulates a Gameboy's central processor and display units, as well as some
				memory controllers for different cartridges.
				Doesn't have all the features that one would want in an emulator, such as a debugger, memory editor, or
				sound, but I may add those in the future.
				It uses SDL for display and button input.

			<p>A Windows based compiler for brainf***, as well as a library for interacting with COFF files<br>
				Mainly a project to learn the fundamentals of creating executables and assembly. It can create valid
				Object
				files, which can be linked to the Windows kernel32.dll.

				Mitre Embedded CTF 2024</a>
			<complete>completed!</complete> <br />
			<p>An embedded security competition that I worked on the Purdue team for</a><br>
				I helped set up the build system for flashing the MAX78000 boards (which are Arm/Thumb based,) with Rust
				code, as well as interop with the C code that the organizers gave us to use. I also did some of the
				mitigations, including basic ASLR and some more advanced glitch attack preventions

			<ongoing>on-going</ongoing><br />
			<p>A very work in progress WASM disassembler/decompiler <br>
				Currently can read a file and most instructions, and then can print some basic WAT assembly.
