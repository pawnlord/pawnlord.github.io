			<h2> C Projects: </h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/tarrasch-editor" id = "link" class="link-hover"> tarrasch editor</a><br/>
			<p>A Linux terminal based text editor based on Nano.<br>
			   It was made in C without using any libraries like ncurses.<br>
			   It currently has only been succesfully tested on Ubuntu XTerm.</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/passm" id = "link" class="link-hover"> passm</a><br/>
			<p>A simple textbased password manager.<br>
			   It can add passwords based on customly selected parameters!</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/simpleshell" id = "link" class="link-hover"> simpleshell</a><br/>
			<p>As one would guess, a pretty simple linux shell.<br>
			   Needs some work, but has some advanced functionality such as background processes</p>
			<h2> Python Projects: </h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/blackmar-chat" id = "link" class="link-hover"> blackmar chat server</a><br/>
			<p>A simple chat server without any identification.<br>
			   Still, it can have admins based off of IP addresses.<br>
			   I would say this is my most complete project.<br>
			   It's commands are sleek, it works with few glitches, and it could be useful</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/ircsome" id = "link" class="link-hover"> ircsome IRC client</a><br/>
			<p>An Command-Line IRC client made with no libraries.<br>
			   Currently pretty simple, with any advanced usage used directly through the protocol.<br>
			   Not much planned for this besides format updates.<br>
			   </p>

			<h1> On-Going Projects: </h1>
			<h2>C Projects:</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/scripts" id = "link" class="link-hover"> scripts</a><br/>
			<p>The Simple Crappy Resource Intensive, Poorly-made Train-wreck of a Script. <br>
			   A project to make a scripting lanuage, which currently can only store variables and do very basic math. <br>
			   The goal is a python-esque language that is turing complete, but it's not even close in it's current state 
			</p>
			<h2>C++ Projects:</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/mome" id = "link" class="link-hover"> mome</a><br/>
			<p>A git style version control system. <br>
			   The name is an archaic way to say git, as in an idiot.<br>
			   Currently can't do much, but I'm working on it! <br>
			   This one is in C++ because I wanted to relearn it. <br>
			   The end goal is a system that can commit, revert, branch, and merge, although I may not complete all features.
