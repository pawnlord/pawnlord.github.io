			<p>An X11 Tiling Window Manager<br>
				A tiling window manager for Linux using X11 and Xlib. Tiling uses a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadtree" id = "inline-link" class="link-hover">quadtree</a> for partitioning space.
				It is not compatible with as many applications as I would like, but I have been using it on my Linux laptop for a while now and it is entirely useable.

			<p>An emulator for the original Gameboy<br>
				This was a very fun project. Emulates a Gameboy's central processor and display units, as well as some memory controllers for different cartridges. 
				Doesn't have all the features that one would want in an emulator, such as a debugger, memory editor, or sound, but I may add those in the future.
				It uses SDL for display and button input.

			<p>A Windows based compiler for brainf***, as well as a library for interacting with COFF files<br>
				Mainly a project to learn the fundamentals of creating executables and assembly. It can create valid Object files, which can be linked to the Windows kernel32.dll.

			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/popcorn" id = "link" class="link-hover">popcorn</a><br/>
			<p>A kernel written in C for x86 processors <br>
			   The main goal of this project was to be able to do some simple kernel operations, like reading and writing to a terminal, and maybe something slightly more advanced like file operations, but it slowly grew in to a much bigger project as I realized how much I wanted to do.
			   Currently implemented features include a malloc implementation, virtualized memory, and some reading and writing syscalls, with multiple tasks currently in production.
			   Currently planned features still include file operations, though we will see if I get to that.

			<a href="https://github.com/frclib-rs/wpilib-rust" id = "link" class="link-hover">frclib-rs</a><br/>
			<p>A semi-port of WPILib to Rust, designed to program robots for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIRST_Robotics_Competition" id = "inline-link" class="link-hover">FRC</a><br>
				I wrote the scheduler and Command API to be more user friendly and similar to the original WPILib, with proc macros being used to get a clean interface.
