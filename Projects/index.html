			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/tarrasch-editor" id = "link" class="link-hover"> tarrasch editor</a><br/>
			<p>A Linux terminal based text editor based on Nano.<br>
			   It was made in C without using any libraries like ncurses.<br>
			   It currently has only been succesfully tested on Ubuntu XTerm.</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/passm" id = "link" class="link-hover"> passm</a><br/>
			<p>A simple textbased password manager.<br>
			   It can add passwords based on customly selected parameters!</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/simpleshell" id = "link" class="link-hover"> simpleshell</a><br/>
			<p>As one would guess, a pretty simple linux shell.<br>
			   Needs some work, but has some advanced functionality such as background processes</p>
			<a href="https://github.com/pawnlord/blackmar-chat" id = "link" class="link-hover"> blackmar chat server</a><br/>
			<p>A simple chat server without any identification.<br>
			   Still, it can have admins based off of IP addresses.<br>
			   I would say this is my most complete project.<br>
			   It's commands are sleek, it works with few glitches, and it could be useful</p>
